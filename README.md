### Due Friday, February 6, 2021, at 11:59pm EST

For this problem set, you will submit to Canvas **a single .zip file**. Detailed instructions for what the .zip file should contain are at the end of this problem set. Note that if you do not submit the files as specified here, there will be a major deduction in your grade for this assignment. Following directions to the letter is a crucial skill for computer programming.

## Getting started

1. If you haven't already, create a folder called `CS1` on your Desktop, in your Documents, or in some place that is easy to find on your computer.

2. In that folder, create a folder called `ps2`. You will put all of the components required for this problem set in the `ps2` folder.

## Part 1: Numbers

1. Do a fancy calculation (practice with parens and operators).

2. Use integer division and mod.


## Part 2: Strings

first practice in the shell

Use command line arguments.
Specify a word, report back length, first letter, last letter, middle letter(s) (which uses integer division)
print from middle to end, from beginning to middle
Concatenate two strings
turn input into an integer 
upper and lower

## Part 3: Combine the two
Use your conversion techniques and string slicing to get the first, third, and final digit of some number.
